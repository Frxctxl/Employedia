# Employedia

## Description
The Employedia is a CLI built with Node.js and stores data using a PostgresQL relational Database. It can store Departments, Roles, and Employees. This process makes it easier and safer to store company data, since its a simple menu and is stored in a local database, so no internet access is needed beyond setup.
